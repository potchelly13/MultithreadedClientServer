# Multithreaded Client-Server System for System Monitoring

## Overview
This project implements a multithreaded client-server application in Java to perform system monitoring tasks. The client communicates with the server using TCP sockets and requests various system information, including uptime, memory usage, and active processes.

## Features
- **Client-Server Communication**: Implements TCP-based client-server architecture.
- **Multithreading**: Server handles multiple client connections simultaneously.
- **System Operations**:
  - Date and Time
  - Uptime
  - Memory Usage
  - Netstat
  - Current Users
  - Running Processes
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculates total and average turn-around times for client requests.

## Technologies
- Java
- Networking (Socket Programming)
- Multithreading
